## About
Grade distribution is a website that allows users to see the grade distribution for the classes of their choice and compare by professor. The goal of this is to make the process of choosing classes easier for students who are worried about getting a bad professor, or for determining the difficulty of their potential schedule much easier.

The frontend of the website was build using React and JavaScript, and the website's styling was complimented with Tailwind CSS. The backend of the website was built with Python and Flask and was using various Python libraries, most importantly, Matplotlib, Pandas and Seaborn, for data processing, analysis, and visualization. The datasets are stored on the server side in csv files sorted by folders for a fast retrieval.

Having such a large data pool for our project, as well as being able to display grade distribution data in a readable and easy to understand manner, yet getting it fast without a lot of computation or excess memory use.
